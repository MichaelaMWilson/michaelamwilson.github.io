## PICU Passport Website

This is a website developed for my senior capstone, the PICU Passport mobile application. This website was created in colloboration with Ever Barillas and Courtney Kaminski. The project was sponsored by Penn State Hershey Medical Center.

I specifically created the carousel of our project documentation, as well as the user guide section of the website. As needed, I made minor CSS changes. I also created the promotional video.

Note: This app's code is confidential, so I cannot share the source code.

The website can also be viewed at everalf1995.github.io/picu until it is removed by the owner.
